# BiocSfaira

Preliminary simple interface from R to Sfaira.  The vignette
is mainly based on a [tutorial](https://github.com/theislab/sfaira_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/user_interface.ipynb) jupyter notebook from the Sfaira
project.  

In the vignette for this package we use zellkonverter to retrieve python-based
computations and help R users explore aspects of embedding and cell type assertion.
